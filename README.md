# DNA Analysis Tool

This code is designed for DNA data analysis, providing functionalities to read DNA segment and function data, check their formats, identify overlap between segments, calculate Pearson Correlation Coefficients (PCC), and compute mean values of functions over specified segments.

## Features

- **Data Reading**: Reads DNA data from files with specific formats (.s for segments and .f for functions).
- **Format Verification**: Ensures data files are in the correct format.
- **Region Overlap Detection**: Identifies overlapping regions between two sets of DNA segments.
- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient Calculation**: Computes the PCC between two function datasets.
- **Mean Calculation Over Segments**: Calculates the mean of function values over specified DNA segments.
